# datalytics_tools
Python codes for data analytics tasks. 


Tool 1 - fetch_data.py
----------------------
One of the core tasks in any data analytics project is to download, fetch or extract data required for the work. This task is often repetitive. A script to automate the process will therefore be helpful. 

fetch_data.py will download data from a given url into a specified destination directory. The downloaded data will also be decompressed if they are zipped from the source.

The script can be run more than once without fear of over-writing data.
